As of September 2024, the Pi Network continues its progress towards launching its Open Mainnet, but the exact date remains unclear. The project recently marked 2,000 days since its launch and is expected to announce a detailed roadmap for enabling official Pi transactions in December 2024. Currently, more than 13 million users have passed the Know-Your-Customer (KYC) verification process, with over six million having migrated to the Mainnet. The final deadline for KYC submissions and migrations is set for September 30, 2024​(

Key aspects of the Pi Network include its use of the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP), which is an energy-efficient alternative to traditional Proof-of-Work (PoW) systems. This allows users to mine Pi tokens using their mobile devices without significant resource consumption. The Pi Network has also expanded its ecosystem, with 70 applications already operational or prepared for launch on the Mainnet​(

GitHub Project Plan for Pi Network Integration
Objective:
To create a Pi Network integration project that enables developers to utilize Pi’s mobile mining infrastructure and decentralized applications (DApps) for future Web3 projects.

Project Scope:

KYC Verification Module:

Implement a system to interface with Pi Network’s KYC process, ensuring that only verified users can interact with the platform.
Integrate a reminder system that prompts users about KYC deadlines.
Mobile Mining Integration:

Develop a mobile-friendly Pi mining interface using the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP).
Ensure energy-efficient algorithms are utilized to minimize resource consumption on users' devices.
Mainnet DApp Development:

Create a set of APIs that allow developers to build decentralized applications on the Pi Network’s Mainnet.
Provide templates for smart contract deployment and interaction with Pi tokens.
Pi Wallet and Transaction Integration:

Develop a secure Pi wallet integration that allows for the storage, transfer, and staking of Pi tokens.
Include transaction history and token exchange capabilities for users post-mainnet launch.
Community Engagement Tools:

Build tools for engaging with Pi’s global community through social features like referrals and trust-building mechanisms.
Integrate Pi's Fireside Forum and Pi Ad Network to allow users to contribute to community discussions and advertising.
Timeline:

Q4 2024: Complete initial integrations for KYC, mining interface, and community tools.
Q1 2025: Release wallet integration and API for DApp development.
Q2 2025: Support Mainnet token transactions post-roadmap announcement.
Repository Setup:

Languages: Python, JavaScript (React for front-end), Solidity (for smart contracts).
Tools: Stellar Consensus Protocol libraries, Web3.js, and mobile frameworks (React Native).
This GitHub project will prepare developers for Pi Network’s full-scale launch, promoting early adoption of its decentralized applications and mining capabilities.
